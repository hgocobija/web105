    <h2 style="color: blue ;">Review</h2>
    
    <p>
        <mark>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallowes </mark>is the last book in the series and the most interesting one.In this final chapter we see the battle between Harry and The Dark Lord that has been building up from the opening scene.It is a great book and leaves many speculations on what is next for J.K Rowling and this legendary series.But Unfortunately for the fans 10 years later there is still no sequel and all we are left with is the small diversion that also takes place in the qizarding world that is called  <sup>Fantastic Beasts and where to Find Them</sup></p>
